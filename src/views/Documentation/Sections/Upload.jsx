        We've created two special components to make it easier for you to create
        a picture/image upload on your form.
      </p>
      <h2>Styles</h2>
      <p>
        You will find the styles for these components in<br />{" "}
        <code>src/assets/scss/material-kit-pro-react/_fileupload.scss</code>.
      </p>
      <h2>ImageUpload</h2>
      <p>
        This component was made to look like{" "}
        <a
          href="https://www.jasny.net/bootstrap/javascript/#fileinput"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"

        image uploads with a preview image after the user selects an image, a
        button for changing the image and one for removing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to submit the image (to save it on your server after it has
        been uploaded) you have to change the <code>handleSubmit</code> function
        in <code>src/components/CustomUpload/ImageUpload.jsx</code> at line 35.
      </p>

      <ImageUpload avatar />
